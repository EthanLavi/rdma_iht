Goal: IHT Operations with rehashing

1. Finish rehash functionality
2. Move away from static PLists
3. Finish populate function
4. Change typedef's back to int, int, 8, 128

Things to look into:

* How does Allocate work? Can I provide parameters in it.
* Can I setup a MemoryPool with self as a peer
* Read makes a copy? Can I do pointer arithmetic?
* How does compare & swap work?
