Goal: IHT Operations with rehashing

[x] done

Goal: Refining my IHT repo

1. Populate function
2. Fix OOM Error (i.e. answer my 5th question?)
3. Concise functions
4. Integrate experiment.proto
5. Look into using docker as a build environment

Things to look into:

* How does Allocate work? Can I provide parameters in it.
* Can I setup a MemoryPool with self as a peer
* How does compare & swap work?
* Read makes a copy? Can I do pointer arithmetic? Do I need to free afterwards?

Q1: OOM
Q2: Memory Pool with self as a Peer
