Goal: IHT Operations with rehashing

1. Finish rehash functionality
2. Move away from static PLists
3. Improve workload driver
4. Finish populate function

Things to look into:
* How does Allocate work? Can I provide parameters in it.
* Can I setup a MemoryPool with self as a peer
* Read makes a copy? Can I do pointer arithmetic?
