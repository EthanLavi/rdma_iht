Goal: IHT Operations with rehashing

[x] done

Goal: Refining my IHT repo

1. Populate function
2. Fix OOM Error (i.e. answer my 5th question?)
3. Fix alignment in Plist and Elist
4. Concise functions
5. Integrate experiment.proto
6. Look into using docker as a build environment

Things to look into:

* How does Allocate work? Can I provide parameters in it.
* Can I setup a MemoryPool with self as a peer
* How does compare & swap work?
* Read makes a copy? Can I do pointer arithmetic?

Q1: OOM
Q2: Memory Pool with self as a Peer
