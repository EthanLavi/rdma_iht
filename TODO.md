Goal: IHT Operations with rehashing

[x] done

Goal: Refining my IHT repo

1. Populate function
2. Kill running servers with a script
3. Fix OOM Error (i.e. answer my 5th question)
4. Concise functions
5. Integrate experiment.proto
6. Look into using docker as a build environment

Things to look into:

* How does Allocate work? Can I provide parameters in it.
* Can I setup a MemoryPool with self as a peer
* Read makes a copy? Can I do pointer arithmetic?
* How does compare & swap work?
* Why am I getting an error when trying to allocate memory after ~1000ish operations
